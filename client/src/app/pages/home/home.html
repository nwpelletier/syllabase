  <h1>Hi</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Welcome to Syllabase, where you can browse through various Piano Syllabi from graded systems
      and publishers around the world.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are curious about a piece's relative difficulty level, you can see where it stands
      grade-wise.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can also look up particular grades from systems, and search up what piece by your favorite
      composers come up.
    </li>
    <li>
      In case you are curious, you can also see which pieces from collections are NOT featured in a
      syllabus.
    </li>
    <li>
      The aim is to help students and teachers explore Syllabus content in an interactive manner, to
      help expand their breadth of knowledge of the piano repertoire.
    </li>
    <li>
      The secondary aim is to help learners find repertoire that is suitable for their current
      level, by looking up pieces they already play, and finding others of the same genre, composer,
      etc that fit in the same grade.
    </li>
    <li class="li-bold">
      I want virtually no 'scrolling' required; several clicks/taps, easy filter methods. I want a
      more modernized way of looking up syllabus material that works for students, teachers, and
      non-technical users.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h2>A common lookup:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>"Am I ready to play Fantasie Impromptu? I've learned Chopin's Op.9 No.2, and Fur Elise"</li>
    <li>You can either:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Look up Fantasie Impromptu, and browse other pieces in the same grade.</li>
      <li>
        Look up Op.9 No.2, and Fur Elise, and check the grade disparity between them and Fantasie
        Impromptu
      </li>
      <li>
        If other pieces you have played do not have a grade (they exist in the database but are not
        on any Syllabi) then it will suggest other pieces from the same catalogue for you to use as
        a comparison.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <hr />
  <h3>Other features I would like to implement</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Links to recordings or sheet music PDF (depending on if this is allowed)</li>
    <li>
      You can see how many times a piece has been viewed (ex: Fantasie Impromptu has been selected
      32times). This can be used to filter "popular" pieces.
    </li>
    <li>Possible "features" list for pieces.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ex: "Chopin Op.25 No.6" features could be "Double Thirds", "Double Notes", and then you
        could query pieces based on those features.
      </li>
      <li>
        Results could include: Debussy's "Etudes pour les Tierces", Liszt's "Feux Follets",
        Rachmaninoff's "Prelude in Eb Minor, Op.23", maybe even Liszt's "Liebestraum No.3"
      </li>
      <li>Maybe there would be a huge bank of features, and users can add them as tags</li>
    </ul>
